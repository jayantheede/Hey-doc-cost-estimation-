**Dialogflow CX Request Cost**
Understanding the cost associated with Dialogflow CX requests is crucial for budgeting AI chatbot development and deployment.
Cost Per Request
Each user message is considered one request. The cost is structured as follows:
1 request = 1 user message
Cost per request = $0.007
Approximate cost in INR = ‚Çπ0.58
Cost Formula
The total cost can be calculated using the following formula:
Cost (‚Çπ) = Number of Requests √ó 0.58
Example Scenarios (Dialogflow CX)
Here are some examples illustrating the cost based on user volume and message frequency:

Users per Month	Avg. Messages per User	Total Requests	Cost in USD	Cost in INR
100 users	10 messages	1,000	$7	~‚Çπ580
1,000 users	10 messages	10,000	$70	~‚Çπ5,810
10,000 users	10 messages	100,000	$700	~‚Çπ58,100
100,000 users	10 messages	1,000,000	$7,000	~‚Çπ5,81,000
Cost Per User Session
A typical user session lasts 2-3 minutes, involving approximately 8-12 user messages. This leads to the following cost per session:
Cost per message: $0.007 (‚Çπ0.58)
For 8 messages: 8 √ó $0.007 = $0.056 ‚âà ‚Çπ4.65
For 12 messages: 12 √ó $0.007 = $0.084 ‚âà ‚Çπ6.95
Therefore, 1 user session costs about ‚Çπ5‚Äì7 on average.
Audio Add-On Cost
If voice capabilities are used (Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech), an additional cost is incurred:
Cost: $0.001 per second of audio
For 120 seconds (2 minutes): 120 sec √ó $0.001 = $0.12 per user
This adds approximately ‚Çπ10 per user extra for voice interaction.
Final Takeaway (Dialogflow CX)
Text bot only: ~‚Çπ5‚Äì7 per user session (8 to 12 req).
Voice bot (STT+TTS): ~‚Çπ15‚Äì17 per user session.

** üåê Public Web Hosting Costs (2025)**
Hosting cost depends mainly on size of your app/website, traffic, and type of hosting.
 

1. Shared Hosting (basic entry-level)
What it is: Your website sits on the same server as hundreds of other sites. 
Best for: Small websites, landing pages, personal projects, very low traffic. 
Cost: 
‚Çπ150‚Äì‚Çπ400/month in India
$2‚Äì$10/month worldwide
Pros: Cheap, beginner-friendly, easy setup. 
Cons: Slow, limited resources, not good for apps or high traffic. 
 

2. VPS (Virtual Private Server)
What it is: A server is split into virtual machines, you get dedicated CPU/RAM. 
Best for: Medium apps, hospital systems, bots, moderate traffic. 
Cost: 
‚Çπ1,000‚Äì‚Çπ3,000/month (India)
$10‚Äì$30/month worldwide
Pros: More power, root access, better performance. 
Cons: Requires technical knowledge, you manage updates & security. 
 

3. Cloud Hosting (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.)
What it is: Pay-as-you-go, scalable hosting on cloud servers. 
Best for: Apps like your Hey Doc! system (appointments, SMS/email). 
Cost: 
Small instance (1 CPU, 1‚Äì2 GB RAM) ‚Üí $8‚Äì$15/month (‚Çπ700‚Äì‚Çπ1200)
Medium instance (2 CPU, 4 GB RAM) ‚Üí $20‚Äì$40/month (‚Çπ1600‚Äì‚Çπ3200)
Pros: Scalable, reliable, works with APIs (email/SMS). 
Cons: More complex setup, costs increase with traffic/usage. 
 

4. Dedicated Server
What it is: You rent the whole physical server. 
Best for: Very high traffic (10,000+ daily visitors). 
Cost: 
‚Çπ7,000‚Äì‚Çπ20,000/month (India)
$80‚Äì$300+/month worldwide
Pros: Maximum control, high performance. 
Cons: Expensive, needs server admin. 
 

‚úÖ Quick Recommendation for You (Hospital Bot & Appointment App)
Since your app:
Uses FastAPI + MongoDB 
Needs Cloud Run + Twilio (SMS) + Gmail (email) 
Will scale slowly (patients booking appointments) 
üëâ Best choice = Google Cloud Run (serverless cloud hosting)
Free tier: 2 million requests/month free. 
Paid: After free tier, ‚Çπ700‚Äì‚Çπ1500/month ($8‚Äì$15) for small scale usage. 
Scales automatically (you don‚Äôt pay when nobody is booking). 
 

üí∞ Clear-Cut Cost Ranges
Small personal site ‚Üí ‚Çπ150‚Äì‚Çπ400/month (Shared) 
Medium web app (like yours) ‚Üí ‚Çπ700‚Äì‚Çπ3000/month (Cloud/VPS)
